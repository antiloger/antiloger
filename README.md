# K.N Piyumina

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm K.N Piyumina, an undergraduate student at Plymouth University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My current research focus is on discrete event simulation using SimPy and exploring its connections with Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

## About Me
- Learning Rust ....
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently engaged in research on discrete event simulation with SimPy.
- ðŸ’¡ Exploring the intersections of discrete event simulation with Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration on projects involving simulation, low-level programming, or the integration of SimPy with ML/NN.
- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about SimPy, low-level programming, or any tech-related topics.
